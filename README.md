Keeper App

I drew inspiration from the note app on our iPhones, which is used to save notes for future reference.

This app was built using 4 components and contains 3 pages.

The home page consists of a header, body, and footer. The body has a container containing a welcoming text and a button that takes you to your notes when clicked.

When you access the notes page, it has a form where your notes can be filled out and saved when the "add" button is clicked.

Additionally, there is a delete button that, when clicked, automatically deletes your notes.

The third page is simply an error page in case you enter the wrong URL.

To return to the homepage, you can simply click on the Keeper icon in the header.
